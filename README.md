# Study_of_Deep_Learning
Study of Deep learning models by experimenting with the different hyper-parameters.
# Summary
In this project, I have tried to learn the effects of different hyper-parameters on our model and how to build our model from basic without using pre-trained model on the given frameworks by using a Keras framework using Tensorflow as a backed.
# Technologies Used
* Jupyter Notebook
* Keras
* Matplotlib
